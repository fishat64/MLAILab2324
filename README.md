This repository contains sourcecode related to my Univesity Lab **_"MA-INF 4306: Lab Development and Application of Data Mining and Learning Systems: Big Data"_** at the University of Bonn.

The addressed topic was **_"A measure for (weak) convexity."_**

The main file is **_Main.ipynb_**

The proposed and implemented measures for convexity on graphs can be found in **_Measures.py_** /-> **_lib.py_**.

The produced dataframes and correspondig graphs are saved in **_shr/_**.

The code to analyse the given dataframes is in **_graphiceval.ipynb_**, resulting in images saved in **_shr/_**.
